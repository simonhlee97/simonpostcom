If you have a Google account, you can access a massive amount of YouTube data using the YouTube Data API (v3), and use that data to add functionality to your website.

You can query and search to find information about a specific channel, playlist, or video (such as number of views, likes).

You'll be able to answer questions like:

<div class='quote'>Which videos published in the last 24 hours got the most views?</div>

Figuring out how to fine-tune your queries is fairly simple, especially if you understand how to add query strings to urls. [Excellent tutorial about query strings](https://flaviocopes.com/urlsearchparams/). The documentation is massive and has a friendly test tool to try out some queries.

### An Example
Let's say you want to display a nice-looking list of the Top 5 Most Viewed videos, published in the last 24 hours, in South Korea (or the USA).
I made a [separate page for the example](/youtube-api/top-five-us-korea) (for now) since data-fetching in Next.js inside blog posts (MDX files) requires some extra tools and configuring. The code for the example is here.

### Requirements and Setup

+ [Google Developer Account](https://developers.google.com/)
+ Create a project in Google Developers Console
+ Create an API key
